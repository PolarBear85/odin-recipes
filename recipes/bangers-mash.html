    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A truly scrumptious dinner recipe whether you have a vegan diet or not. The humble potato is arguably one of our favourite things on the planet - it's so versatile and always 100% delicious. Today we couldn't decide whether we wanted a classic jacket potato, or bangers and mash - so we combined the two together!</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        
        <h4>Before you start</h4>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C</li>
        <ol>
            <h4>Bake the potatoes</h4>
            <li>Pierce your jacket potatoes and add them to a baking tray. Pop them in the oven for 40 minutes or until they're soft</li>
            <h4>Make the bolognese</h4>
            <li>Place your veggie sausages in a bowl and microwave for two minutes or until soft</li>
            <li>Take a fork and mash up the sausages so they are a mince like consistency and set to one side</li>
<li>Add the oil to a pan on a medium/high heat and add the onions, celery and carrots. Let these cook down until they soften</li>
<li>Add the garlic and salt and mix through, followed by the plant-based sausage mix</li>
<li>Once this has cooked off for a couple minutes add the Italian herbs, tomato puree, pepper, sugar and soy sauce and mix together before adding the chopped tomatoes. Stir these through and set to one side</li>
            <h4>Prepare the mash</h4>
            <li>Take your jacket potatoes out of the oven and slice off the top, scoop out the potato in the middle and add this to a separate bowl (where we will make the mashed potato)</li>
            <li>In the bowl with the potatoes add the plant-based butter, salt, pepper and whole grain mustard</li>
            <li>Mash and mix together with a potato masher and add a splash of plant-based milk to make the texture slightly creamy</li>
            <h4>Build the potatoes</h4>
            <li>Fill the hollowed out potato with bolognese, then add a small layer of plant-based cheese and finally a dollop of mashed potato
            <li>Put back in the oven for 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>Add plant-based cheese, fresh basil and chilli flakes to garnish and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
